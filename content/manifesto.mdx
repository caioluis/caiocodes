I speak as a Software Engineer, but more than that, as a human being.

This is the manifesto that I write as of the 21st of February, 2023. I've decided to dedicate my life to fight for the ones that can't fight, and to fight for myself included. The world needs to change for the better, and I am totally commited to give my soul to accomplish it.

As a Software Engineer, I managed to have a really great life in an early age, earning salaries that I never thought were possible for me and connecting with people that I would never meet otherwise.

To give you some context, I'm a Brazilian living in Portugal for the last 6 years. Just by living in another country, another continent, I'm already living in a situation that many people dream of. I don't have a university deegre, I haven't even finished one of the disciplines of my high school. I became depressed during COVID and I haven't got out of it just yet. So... I wasn't expecting to be successful at all.

But things changhed. I got a lucky internship, got promoted, changed jobs and, for once, my gross salary was just as high as the country's Prime Minister. That's insane. Statiscally, I'm a gigantic exception.

And then my depression hit again. I resigned from my job. Thrice. Trying to find happiness somewhere else instead of trying to find inside of me.

But I still had many great things, I am just deeply depressed, but I'm fully aware that my material conditions are ok. I just need to fix a few dozen traumas.

Meanwhile, people starve in the streets. People die in the winter, because they don't have anywhere else to get a shelter. People die in floods. People die out of exhausting during summer. People are getting shot for no reason other than the color of their skin. People can't pay medical bills and die earlier than expected. I could go on and on, but you know where I'm going to, don't you?

Thousands of houses are empty in Portugal. We have plenty of food to feed the entire world. We have capacity to treat diseases. But we won't.

It's difficult to explain in a simple readme at GitHub, but I know for sure this is for capitalism to blame. I'm happy to explain further if you'd like to contact me.

For those who are wondering: don't worry, if we ever work together in a startup, I won't "sabotage the business" and I won't be "lazy"; in fact, I tend to overwork a lot, because I want my peers to succeed. Don't let the prejudice over communism get over your head, I'm a human just like you.

I'm just setting an agreement with the society: I will fight with the means I have for this to end. I'm commited to bring education for free and as acessible as possible to as many people as I can. I will study all the theory that I lack, I will study pedagogy, and I am going to spread this knowledge through my community and through the whole world.

For us, Software Engineers, it is too easy to forget how bad can life be sometimes. But this is only because we let it be.
