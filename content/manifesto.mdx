I speak as a software engineer, but more than that, as a human being.

This is the manifesto that I write as of the 21st of February, 2023. I've decided to dedicate my life to fighting for the ones that can't fight, and to fight for myself included. The world needs to change for the better, and I am committed to giving my soul to accomplish that.

As a Software Engineer, I was able to live a wonderful life at a young age, earning salaries that I never imagined were possible for me and meeting people I would never have met otherwise.

To give you some context, I'm a Brazilian who has lived in Portugal for the last 6 years. Simply by living in another country, on another continent, I am already in a situation that many people wish for.I don't have a university degree; I haven't even finished one of the disciplines of my high school. I became depressed during COVID, and I haven't gotten out of it just yet. So... I wasn't expecting to be successful at all.

But things changed. I got a lucky internship, got promoted, changed jobs, and, for once, my gross salary was just as high as the country's prime minister. That's insane. Statistically, I'm a gigantic exception.

And then my depression hit again. I resigned from my job. Thrice. Trying to find happiness somewhere else instead of trying to find it inside of me.

But I still had many great things; I am just deeply depressed, but I'm fully aware that my material conditions are okay. I just need to fix a few dozen traumas.

Meanwhile, people starve in the streets. People die in the winter because they don't have anywhere else to get shelter. People die in floods. People die of exhaustion during the summer. People are getting shot for no reason other than the color of their skin. People can't pay medical bills and die earlier than expected. I could go on and on, but you know where I'm going, don't you?

Thousands of houses are empty in Portugal. We have enough food to feed the entire world. We can treat diseases. But we won't.

It's difficult to explain in a simple readme at GitHub, but I know for sure that this is capitalism's fault. I'm happy to explain further if you'd like to contact me.

For those who are wondering: don't worry; if we ever work together in a startup, I won't "sabotage the business" and I won't be "lazy"; in fact, I tend to overwork a lot because I want my peers to succeed. Don't let the prejudice over communism get to your head; I'm a human just like you.

I'm just setting an agreement with society: I will fight with the means I have for this to end. I'm committed to making education free and as accessible as possible to as many people as I can. I will study all the theories that I lack, I will study pedagogy, and I am going to spread this knowledge throughout my community and the whole world.

For us, software engineers, it is too easy to forget how bad life can be sometimes. But this is only because we let it be.

A burguesia fede. E t√° na hora da gente limpar.
