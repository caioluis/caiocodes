# OLD REPO
### This is not the repo currently used in my blog


## Welcome to my website and blog

Even though I don't think having a website and blog is necessary to be a software engineer, people always ask me if I do have one. I find it ridiculous to build one just to satisfy some people. But I do want, in fact, to write down on my own blog and have my own space on the internet. So after much pressure and procrastination, here it is.

## Tech used

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Analytics**: [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics)

## TODO

As you may have noticed, this is a fork from Lee's (Vercel) website. However, as time goes by, it will have my own shape.
There are a few things about the implementation that I don't fully agree with him, but it works really well, so I thought it could be a good start.

I will incorporte other people's PRs on his repo, and you may as well fork this one and do as you please.

- [ ] Implement Framer Motion suggestions from a contributor's PR
- [ ] Create more animations using Framer Motion
- [ ] Write more blog posts
- [ ] Perhaps use a proper CMS with a Webhook attached to my repo 
- [ ] Fix some visual glitches
- [ ] Finish the about me page, adding my work experience there
- [ ] Implement * new blog post notification * feature. (thanks for the suggestion, marisa)
- [ ] Localization feature to post in multiple languages.
