## TODO

As you may have noticed, this is a fork from Lee's (Vercel) website. However, as time goes by, it will have my own shape.
There are a few things about the implementtationsthat I don't fully agree with him, but it works really well, so I thought it could be a good start.

I will incorporte other people's PRs on his repo, and you may as well fork this one and do as you please.

[ ] Implement Framer Motion suggestions
[ ] Create more animations using Framer Motion
[ ] Write more blog posts
[ ] Perhaps use a proper CMS with a Webhook attached to my repo
